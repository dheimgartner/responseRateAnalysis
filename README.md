## How to contribute

The preferred way to contribute is via a pull request.

A meaningful contribution implies the following two steps:

1. Update the `response_rates.xlsx` file in `data-raw` as good as humanly possible.
2. Add your bibtex entry to `inst/CITATION`.

For discussions or suggestions (e.g. adding a new variable to the `response_rates` "database") please open an issue or preferably a pull request.
